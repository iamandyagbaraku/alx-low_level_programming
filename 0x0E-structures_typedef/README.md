## 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

## Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* What are structures, when, why and how to use them
* How to use typedef

[dog.h](./dog.h)
```
Define a new type struct dog with the following elements:
```
* name, type = char *
* age, type = float
* owner, type = char *

[1-init_dog.c](./1-init_dog.c)
```
Write a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog
```
* Prototype: void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner);
